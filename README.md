# MAC address spoofer for Apple Macbooks
Rock on free cafe or library wifi that impose horrendous limit on your network usage.
It spoofs your device's MAC address, run `./spoof_mac.sh go` to turn it on, and run `./spoof_mac.sh go` again to turn off. You get a random MAC addr everytime. 
So to extend on an existing spoofing session, turn off, then turn on again.
